      <h3>Online Parameter Estimation Methods for Dynamical Systems</h3>
      <h4><i>August 2024 - Present</i></h4>
      <p>
          With the ever growing market interest in autonomous vehicles around the world, many car manufacturing car companies, have sought out to improve 
          autonomous vehicles by improving overall safety while operating the vehicle. Other's have sought to explore methods to make these vehicles more 
          algorithmic efficient and test algorithmic robustness. Many challenges up to this day exist with autonomous vehicles, mostly from the inherient 
          trait of autonomous vehicles by considered to be "dyanmic" and never linear.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
          We seek to explore online methods for parameter estimation and explore and test robustness to noise, excitation condition analysis, the 
          introduction of adaptive forgetting factors, and parameter convergence under finite excitation (FE).

      <h3>Modeling Disease Spread Using SIR Agent Based Framework (ABM): Kinetic Monte Carlo Approach</h3>
      <h4> <i>May 2024 - August 2024</i></h4>
      <p>
        Using pre-existing computational methods such as Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, this research study intends to investigate the dynamics of disease 
        transmission using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) with an agent-based modeling framework (ABM) on lattice-like structures for a controlled 
        movement population vs an unrestricted movement population; through simulations to analyze the relationships between susceptible(S), infected(I), 
        recovered(R) populations in an environment in these circumstances. Using these methods, we simulate the stochastic processes that govern disease 
        transmission and recovery on the lattice grid, providing a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the disease spread. We anticipate that the overall 
        findings will uncover iterative patterns in disease transmission, highlighting the critical importance of spatial structure and stochastic effects on 
        population dynamics. Furthermore, we expect these results to offer deeper insights into epidemic dynamics, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of disease 
        control strategies for future outbreaks. However, future work is needed to address two unknown areas. First, the impact of different lattice configurations 
        on disease dynamics should be investigated to comprehend how spatial structures influence disease spread. This should include exploring various spatial 
        configurations. Second, further investigation is required into how different temperatures affect disease transmission within restricted populations in 
        lattice-like structures compared to populations not restricted by these physical conditions.

      <h3>Modeling Ecological Time-Series Population with SINDy</h3>
      <h4> <i>April 2025</i></h4>
      <p>
        This project was created for the Applied Mathematics Challenge 2025 at the University of California, Merced. It tackles an ecological modeling problem 
        posed by the Department of Wildlife: predicting the bobcat population over the next 90 days based on observed sightings of bobcats and their primary prey 
        cottontail rabbits. The modeling is performed using a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system, implemented as a system of ODEs. We use real data, 
        interpolation, parameter estimation via optimization, and simulate future dynamics to determine whether wildlife control measures may be necessary.
