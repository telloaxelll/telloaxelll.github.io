      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there, I’m Axel. I’m an Applied Mathematics student at UC Merced, specializing in Computational and Data Science. My academic and research interests lie at the 
        intersection of data science, machine learning, mathematical modeling, and dynamical systems.
      </p>
      <p><br>
        I’m currently conducting research on how Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems can learn and adapt to dynamic environments using data-driven techniques like Recursive Least Squares (RLS), system identification, and other methodologies. I’ve also worked on modeling ecological systems, using SINDy and 
        least squares methods to estimate parameters in predator-prey dynamics in the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey systems.
      </p>
      <p><br>
        I was recently awarded a research fellowship through the National Institutes of Health to further develop my work in dynamical system learning. Through this opportunity, I’m focused on exploring 
        how mathematical theory can be integrated with modern computational tools to simulate, analyze, and optimize 
        real-world systems.
      </p>
      <p><br>
        I’m seeking research opportunities or collaborations in applied mathematics, AI for control systems, or data-driven modeling. Long-term, I aim to contribute to the advancement of intelligent systems grounded in rigorous mathematical foundations.

        I look forward to connecting with you and learning from others in the field.
      </p>
